# Employee Directory
The Employee Directory allows the user to view an entire fictional employee directory at once so that the user has quick access to their information. An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. The employees can be sorted alphabetically by last or first name, and can be searched using the same parameters. This project was created with React.js, its UI was broken into components, and the component's states are managed and the application responds to user events.

## Installation
